## Install

> This configuration is **tailored for my personal workflow**. Therefore it is not suggested for you to use it directly. However, you can make it a start point of your own configuration.

1. Install `git`, and clone the repo as `.emacs.d`.
2. Init and update all git submodules.
3. Write `custom.el` based on `example-custom.el`.
4. For Microsoft Windows:
   - Make sure `msys2` or `mingw` is installed on Windows, as a C compiler is required to compile some packages.
   - If smart-input-source should be enabled, add `./3rd-party/im-select/im-select.exe` to path.
5. One the first run, do `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` for icon support.
6. Optional modules:
   - Install `opencc` for Chinese conversion support.
   - Install `pandoc` for document conversion support, which is needed by many features, such as Markdown preview.
