;;; init-basic.el --- A placeholder module.  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:

;; This module just make sure that all the basic modules have been loaded. Most
;; non-basic modules should require this module to silence warnings.

;;; Code:

(require 'init-keybindings)

(provide 'init-basic)

;;; init-basic.el ends here
