#+TITLE: Zyxir's Emacs Configuration

My GNU Emacs configuration, which is:

- *Minimal*. I practise [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism][minimalism]] in my daily life, as well as in
  Emacs.
- *Manageable*. Advanced approaches are used to minimize the cost of
  managing the configuration.
- *Functional*. This configuration satisfies most of my needs. See
  [[*Usage]].

The whole config is inside [[./init.org][init.org]].

* Usage

I use Emacs in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), to:

- Use [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]], [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][org-journal]], and other org utilities.
- Write documents in: LaTeX, markdown, org.
- Write codes in: Python.

* Install
