** Installation

Clone this repository to ~~/.emacs.d~, and install the font ~Fira Code~.  Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, third-party packages will be automatically installed.

It is recommended to install these third-party tools to enhance user experience:

- Ripgrep :: Fast text search.  Used by various commands in ZyEmacs.

** Customization

Most behavior of this configuration is hard-coded.  That is because I am currently the only user of this configuration, and I can change any behavior by modifying the code.  However there are some machine-dependent settings that is not consistent in every computing environemnt of mine.  It is recommended to configure these settings via the ~customize~ UI:

- ~zy/font-size~ :: This determines the default font size.  Customize this according to the screen size of the computing device.
- ~TeX-view-program-selection~ :: This determines what program is used to preview TeX output.  Just choose one in the default list.  In fact it has pretty decent defaults and works out of the box.
