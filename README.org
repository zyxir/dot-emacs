** Installation

Clone this repository to ~\tilde{}/.emacs.d~.  Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, third-party packages will be automatically installed.

It is recommended to install these third-party tools to enhance user experience:

- Ripgrep :: Fast text search.  Used by various commands in ZyEmacs.

** Customization

Most behavior of this configuration is hard-coded.  That is because I am currently the only user of this configuration, and I can change any behavior by modifying the code.  However there are some machine-dependent settings that is not consistent in every computing environemnt of mine.  It is recommended to configure these settings via the ~customize~ UI:

- ~zy/font-size~ :: This determines the default font size.  Customize this according to the screen size of the computing device.
- ~TeX-view-program-selection~ :: This determines what program is used to preview TeX output.  Just choose one in the default list.  In fact it has pretty decent defaults and works out of the box.

** Code Style

This configuration conforms to [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][The Emacs Lisp Style Guide]] by Bozhidar Bastov.  Symbol names in this configuration follow the following conventions (which is derived from the naming conventions of [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]):

- ~zy-[-]NAME~ :: A non-interactive function or variable.
- ~zy/NAME~ :: A public command to be used interactively, via =M-x= or a keybinding.
- ~zy-[-]NAME-a~ :: Function meant to be used (exclusively) as an advice for other functions.
- ~zy-[-]NAME-h~ :: Function meant to be used (exclusively) as a hook.
- ~zy-[-]NAME-fn~ :: A strategy function.  A good rule of thumb for what makes a strategy function is: is it interchangeable? Can it be replaced with another function with a matching signature?
- ~NAME!~ :: A public macro that is provided as a syntactic sugar.
