* A simple Emacs config
#+html: </div>

Lightweight Emacs configuration for my daily need.

- *Supported Emacs version*: Emacs 28.1 or higher (but 29+ is recommended).
- *Supported operating systems*:
  - Windows (with MSYS2).
  - WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux), the distro is Ubuntu in my case.
  - Linux, Arch Linux in my case.

** Philosophy

- Efficiency :: Being fast and productive is the utmost goal.
- Minimal :: Stick to a simple, text-based UI.  No fancy graphics.
- Personalized :: Carefully tailored for my own needs.

** Screenshots

The following screenshot was taken on an Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS machine with Gnome Wayland.

** Installation

Clone this repository, along with its submodules, to ~$HOME/.emacs.d~.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone --recurse-submodules -j$(nproc) git@github.com:zyxir/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Run Emacs with ~emacs --debug-init~, and third-party packages will be automatically installed.

These third-party programs enable additional functionalities of my configuration:

- Fd :: Fast filesystem search.  Used by commands like ~project-find-file~.
- OpenCC :: Provide Simplified/Traditional Chinese conversion.
- Ripgrep :: Fast text search.  Used by commands like ~consult-ripgrep~ and ~rg~.

Some features requiring additional setup are listed below.

*** Rime

~librime~ must be available for the built-in Rime input method to compile.  On Microsoft Windows, launch Emacs inside Mingw64 to compile it, and it will work afterwards even if no in Mingw64.

*** Vterm

~cmake~ and ~libtool~ must be available for the built-in terminal Vterm to compile.  Vterm is not available on Windows.  Just ~M-x vterm~ inside Emacs, and it compiles.

** Customization

Most behavior of this configuration is hard-coded.  That is because I am currently the only user of this configuration, and I can change any behavior by modifying the code.  However, there are some machine-dependent settings that is not consistent in every computing environment of mine.  It is recommended to configure these settings via the ~customize~ UI:

- ~zy~default-theme~ :: Default theme to use.  Must be one of the Doom Themes.
- ~zy~font-size~ :: This determines the default font size.  Customize this according to the screen size of the computing device.
- ~zy~zybox-dir~ :: The location of Zybox, which is my own cloud file center.
- ~TeX-view-program-selection~ :: This determines what program is used to preview TeX output.  Just choose one in the default list.  It has some pretty decent defaults and works out of the box.

** Code Style

This configuration conforms to [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][The Emacs Lisp Style Guide]] by Bozhidar Bastov.  Symbol names in this configuration follow the following conventions (which is derived from the naming conventions of [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]):

- `*NAME*` :: A global constant.
- ~zy-[-]NAME~ :: A non-interactive function, macro or variable.
- ~zy/NAME~ :: A public command to be used interactively, via =M-x= or a keybinding.
- ~zy~NAME~ :: A customization option that is defined via ~defcustom~.
- ~zy-[-]NAME-a~ :: Function meant to be used (exclusively) as advice for other functions.
- ~zy-[-]NAME-h~ :: Function meant to be used (exclusively) as a hook.
- ~zy-[-]NAME-fn~ :: A strategy function.  A good rule of thumb for what makes a strategy function is: is it interchangeable? Can it be replaced with another function with a matching signature?
- ~NAME!~ :: A public macro that is provided as a syntactic sugar.
